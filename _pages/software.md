**In construction**

Since I started coding during my PhD I wrote multiple pieces of codes. Some more useful than others and some better written than others. It is only during my postdoc time that I started to think that since 95% of my time in research is passed coding something I might as well learn how to write it correctly and how to release in the wild.

And so I did! I learnt how to use github, how to write documentation, tests, how to package something etc...Some have also been published in journals!
So here is the list of Software I have worked on. They are more or less in reversed chronological order.

<font color="orange" style="font-size:25px">STON: SofTware for petrOgraphic visualisatioN</font>

During my first year as Head of RSE in Sheffield I took on a small software project with a researcher in Germany, Evgenia Dammer. The goal of the work was to create a tool that would make her daily work easier. We created STON, an interface that is focused on the visualisation and analysis of thin sections of rock and minerals samples. It is made entirely in Python using PySide6 and fully open source. We release a first version in 2025 and published it in the Journal of Open Source Software (see [here](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.08144) for the paper). You can find the documentation hosted in [github](https://romain-thomas-shef.github.io/STON/).

SCUBA is the project I started at the Very Large Telescope. Each night, hundreds of Gb of data are created at the VLT. These data are all different. They can be simple images of regions of sky (like with FORS2 imaging mode), data cube (like with MUSE or KMOS), spectra (Xshooter, or the now retired VIMOS). Each of these instrument is very specific and the data they produce have to be checked carefully to make sure that they comply with observer requirements. SCUBA's role is to do exactly this, check each single piece of data taken at each instrument and tell the observer/telescope operator if this is compliant with the requirements. We started the implementation in the UT2 telescope and then it spreaded all over the observtory. While I am not working at the VLT anymore, I know that SCUBA is still actively developed (and I am quite proud of it!). SCUBA was presented and published at the [SPIE conference](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11449/2560271/The-SCUBA-project---First-layer-of-quality-control/10.1117/12.2560271.full). Unfortunately, SCUBA is not open source (:disappointed:).
