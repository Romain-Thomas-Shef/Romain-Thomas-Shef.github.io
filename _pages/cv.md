<font color="orange" style="font-size:25px">2023 - Present: Head of Research Software Engineering [RSE], University of Sheffield, UK</font>

* <font color="lime"> Main Role</font>
As Head of Research Software Engineering, my role is to ensure the long-term sustainability and stability of the team and its members. I led the definition and oversee the implementation of the strategic direction of the RSE team in alignment with institutional research goals and Open Research principles. 
I am responsible for overseeing the team’s performance, financial management, and governance. A key part of my role is to lead engagement and advocacy for the RSE role both within the university and externally. 
This helps me support and develop the RSE community to enhance research quality and promote recognition of diverse research contributions.
