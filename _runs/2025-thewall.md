That's the big one! It arrived! My first 100k! And also my Ultra #10. For this race I am not alone! Ola, my wife (<3) is following the race with a car and will be there at aid stations, and my friend (and former colleague/Boss) Andrea, a German Astronomer leaving in Chile (where I used to work before) has decided to join me for this race. As I am quite scared of the 100k bar I am very happy to have someone running with me!
