This talk is part of the second delivery of the [FAIR programme](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/) by the RSE team at the University of Sheffield. 

It explores how software is developed in academia and how we can plan the development to help make the software more stable and more FAIR. It is the second time I am delivering this talk and you can find the previous delivery that has been recorded [here](https://orda.shef.ac.uk/articles/media/FAIR2_for_Research_Software_training_programme_Software_Management_plan_licences_and_dissemination/27652128/1). The first delivery was done with a few colleagues from the University: Ric Campbell, Jenni Adams & Kate O'Neill. Due to problems of availability, I have delivered this one on my own, using Ric, Jenni and Kate meterial from 2024.
